=== Suggested requirements

* The `realpath` command-line utility, e.g. the https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/realpath-invocation.html[GNU coreutils one].
* The `tac` command-line utility, also offered by GNU coreutils.

== To build

* To build this Docker container image up from all images it depends on, issue once per shell session:
+
[source,Sh]
----
build_all() {
    set -e
    for packer_file in $(find . $(git submodule --quiet foreach --recursive 'pwd') -maxdepth '1' -type 'f' -name 'packer.json' | tac)
    do
        set -x
        packer build "${packer_file}"
        set +x
    done
    set +e
}
+
* From then on you may issue (as long as your current working directory mentioned in the first steps is still correct) `build_all ;` to start the build.
----

== To run

* First make sure your current working directory is the root directory of your local copy of this repository, and that the previously described build process has completed successfully.
* Next, if it hasn't been imported yet, import the Docker container image. E.g. issue:
+
[source,Sh]
----
docker import - 'docker.clarin.eu/alpine-python_3:latest' < 'images/latest.tar'
----

=== ... interactively

Issue:
+
[source,Sh]
----
docker run -v $(realpath resources/pyff_config/)':/srv/pyff_config/' -i -t --entrypoint='/bin/sh' 'docker.clarin.eu/alpine-python_3'
----
